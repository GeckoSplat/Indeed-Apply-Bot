# Indeed-Apply-Bot
## Bot to automatically apply to jobs on Indeed.com, written in Python using Selenium.
---
This Bot is to automate job search and application on Indeed.com . You will need the Selenium library installed. Open a terminal : 

**pip install selenium**

Selenium needs a driver to interact with your web browser. I used chromedriver. Download this from Google [HERE](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

**Use:**

Clone/Download this repo.

Edit config.json.example with your relevant information. Email etc. Delete ".example" from the end of the file.

Run with terminal command : 

python (or python3) main.py

This code is my first real attempt at anything interactive with webpages. It is updated and hopefully improved intermittently. Feel free to fork, clone , and tinker as you wish. Hopefully it helps someone out .
